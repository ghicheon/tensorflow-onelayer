# TensorFlow Neural Network Lab - One Layer 

A Jupyter notebook that creates a single layer neural network in TensorFlow and Preprocess notMNIST data and train a neural net on it.

The notebook has 3 problems to solve:
 - Problem 1: Normalize the features
 - Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors
 - Problem 3: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, and batch size for the best accuracy
